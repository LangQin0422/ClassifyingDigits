# ClassifyingDigits
___
## Project Preview
The goal of this work is to develop and train a classifier to distinguish images of handwritten
digits from the famous MNIST data set. This work consists of three sub-tasks in order to achieve the goal:
1) investigate the dimensionality of data by Principle Component Analysis; 2) determine the number of
Principle Component Analysis modes to approximate up to certain percentage; and 3) build Ridge regression
model with cross validation for classification.
